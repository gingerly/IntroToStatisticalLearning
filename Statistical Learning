*Example: Develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of one or more media budgets.
Advertising budgets are the input variables/predictors/independent variables/features/variables. X_1, X_2 ...
Sales is the output variable/response/dependent variable.Y

* Y = f(X) + E.
- Set of approaches for estimating f is called statistical learning.

* Why Estimate f?
Prediction and Inference.

*Prediction is used when Xs are available but Y cannot be easily obtained.
