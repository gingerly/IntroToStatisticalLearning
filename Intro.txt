*Supervised Learning: Predicting or estimating an output based on one or more inputs.

*Unsupervised Learning: There are inputs but no supervising output. Learn the relationships from data.

*Predict outcome(ForEg Wage) from multiple factors like age, education, year.

*Regression Probelem: Predict a continuous or quantitative output value.

*Classification Problem; Categorical. Eg: Smarket data, predicting index falls in up bucket or down bucket.

*Clustering Problem: Example: Customers that are similar to each other.
Principal components each dim might correpond to one cluster.

*Least Squares aka Linear Regression.

*No single approach will perform well in all possible applications.
